This repository contains Activiti 7.x Examples

## spring-boot-sample-activiti

This shows the v7 engine in action by providing a project based upon the starter. You can hit rest endpoints on this project to start process instances and action tasks.

This project includes a quickstart that invokes a docker-compose to start with the engine components running as separate services.

## emergency-call-center

This is a demo of using the engine in a microservices environment. Here only the core engine is used, not all of the REST services.
